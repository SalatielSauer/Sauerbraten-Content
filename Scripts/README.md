# Sauerbraten-Scripts
  ##### Some useful scripts (others not so much) that i made for Sauerbraten, but also, with luck, can work in derived games, such as Redeclipse.
  
# Installation
 
    1. Download the file
    2. Copy and Paste the file into your Sauerbraten directory
    3. Exec the file by either appending your autoexec.cfg or executing "/exec file.cfg" ingame
 * (You can also use the [loopexec.cfg](https://github.com/SalatielSauer/Sauerbraten-Content/blob/master/Scripts/loopexec.cfg "loopexec.cfg: execute multiple scripts from a folder") script, with it you can use the execfile command to execute an entire folder)
